# GetStream Chat App with Angular

This is a chat example using [Stream](https://getstream.io/)!

## Development

Make sure you create your own *.env* file using the example env and paste in your [Stream](https://getstream.io/) keys!

Run `netlify dev` to bring up the app & functions. Navigate to `http://localhost:8888/` to access the app, because the functions need to run on the same domain to prevent CORS issues.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
